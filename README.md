## **UX**
This section describes the UX process of this Project. 

### Project Description

This Gym website developed as a First MileStone Project for Code Institute. The main idea behind this website is to showcase a Gym's ideology of staying fit and healthy.

### **Project's Design Process**

The whole process of the user experience design process is laid out on the following five UI/UX Planes.

#### Strategy Plane

The obvious goal of any Business is to get exposure by different advertisement means, referrals, or word of mouth. A product or a project A Company makes could be anything like a  Website, a mobile App, Online Flight Booking System, or Weather checking App.


The main questions asked in the strategy plane (in this Project which is a Gym's website) are
   *    Who is this site for?
   *    What are the aims of this Webiste?
   *    What can a user learn from this Website?
   *    Is the Website easy to navigate?

The questions asked are the core elements of the Strategy Plane. The website answers all the questions in this strategy plane of UX Design process. 
   *    This Website is developed for the users who love staying fit or who want to lose some weight, or tone their bodies, even who wants to get out of the daily dull routine life and take on a new health challenge.
   *    The main aims of this website are to get new customers, retain the current ones, and retrieve the old ones.
   *    A User can learn about the facilities offered in the Gym. By showcasing upcoming workout classes and special offers.
   *    The website is easy to navigate, Its not cluttered with so many objects or crazy fonts or pixelated photos. A user can easily find everything on the website and can reach the website owner in few clicks.

I have designed this website on the above Strategy plane. The Website is easy to navigate. It is aimed at users who are into health and fitness. The Website visitors will find helpful information about the Gym's offerings.

#### Scope Plane

In this Plane of the UX Process, I have designed this website based on the strategy plane by adding the content and features for a Gym's Website. The following questions have been answered in this Plane.
   *    What Content is provided on this Website?
   *    What functionalities are offered on this Website for a user to achieve his/her website visit?
   *    Does the Website has ample information for a user?
   *    Does the Website has specific features and elements to compete with others in the same business?

All the above questions have been answered in the development of this Website. The website provides all the specific features and functions for a user to fully achieve his/her goal.

   *    The content provided on this website is for the people who are into fitness and a healthy lifestyle or who wants to join a Gym.
   *    A user can Join a particular workout class by click Join Button. A user can reach the Website owner by filling an onsite query form, by email, or by phone a phone call. A user can choose any Gym's Subscription package by clicking that Package and sending the query to the Gym's Owner.
   *    The Website has all the information about the Team, Facilities, Classes, Fee structure, Contact information, and Timings in the form of photos, images, and written content.
   *    The Website offers Upcoming and new Fitness trends and Offers free classes and Personal Training Sessions to stay ahead of their competitors.

#### Structure Plane
 
Structure Plane is a very important stage of developing a Website. It is a way of user interaction with a website. The main aim of this plane is to make it is easy for the website's visitors to achieve his/her goal in 2 to 3 steps. The Following Questions are answered in this Plane.

   *    Can a user easily navigate the website?
   *    Does a user understand the structure of the website?
   *    Are the icons and images presented in an easy way for a user to understand the need for these elements?
   *    Can a user achieve his/her website visit in few clicks?
   *    Can a Developer or anyone managing the website easily make any changes?

The Structure of this website is laid out on the above questions. 
   *    It is a one-page website with a Sticky Navbar on the top. It has Six sections anchored together with their respective sections. By clicking any Menu Link the user will be taken to that section.
   *    The Website is developed on the industry-standard navigation system for a desktop, tablet, and mobile user.
   *    The icons, images, photos, and all the other elements presented on the website clearly state their purpose and a user can easily understand their needs.
   *    A user can reach his/her goal within 2-3 steps. The buttons provided on the website are linked to particular sections in a hierarchical structure.
   *    The Website structure or any addition in a section can be achieved easily. All the coding is clearly marked with comments for a particular section of the website. An industry-standard framework is used to develop this website.

#### Skeleton Plane
I have laid out the skeleton plane for a user to clearly understands the information and move around upon that information. Everything is organized in a harmonious way for a user to navigate the website easily. I have Used XD Wireframes to achieve the presentation of all the elements of the skeleton Plane.
   *    The Placement of Buttons, Images, Icons, Headings, and text are placed accordingly.
   *    All the Elements and their functionality is easily accessible by a user of the website.
   *    The navigation system clearly indicates a user how to move around the website.
   *    The information given on the Website in the form of text blocks, images or icons clearly helps an easy user interaction.
   *    The wireframing is the most important element of the Skeleton plane. 

##### Please see the Wireframes below.

  -    [Desktop-Laptop-LargeScreenst-Wireframe](/documentation/wireframes/Desktop-laptop-LargeScreens.jpg)

#### Surface Plane
The surface is the visual representation of the Website. It forms an interface with the colors, fonts, graphics, and icons used on the website. The Surface Plane is designed on the following questions.
   *    Is the interface user friendly?
   *    Do Colors and fonts incorporate with the theme of the Website?
   *    Do the images and text used on the website compliments each other?
   *    Do the images and icons used clearly represent their need and help a user to interact with their functionality?

The above questions were answered as a sum of all the planes in the development of the Surface plane.
   *    The Website as an interface is designed for easy navigation for any device user. All the elements are presented according to size and placement.
   *    I have used a dark interface for this Website thus used the combination of dark and light colors for the background, fonts, buttons, and image overlays. 
        *   Colors Used
            *   Background Color: ```#1b1b1b```
            *   Font Colors: ```tomato``` ```antiquewhite```  ```#fff```

#### Issues Found
   *    There was an issue found after deploying the project, the images weren't showing up so I changed the file paths and it corrected that issue.
   *    The li (timing) in the footer would turn into telephone link on iPhones and iPads. The issue was resolved by adding a Unicode Zero Width Space character (&#8203) in the middle of the value. 

###     **Deployment**

####    Github Pages

The following steps were taken to deploy the Project on Github Pages.

   *    I logged in to the GitHub account and selected the [Github Repository](https://github.com/faisalnadeem78/Milestone-Project-1)
   *    At the top of the Repository, I Clicked the "Settings" button and was directed to the Settings page.
   *    I scrolled down the page and found the  "GitHub Pages" section.
   *    Under the "Source" I clicked the "None" in the dropdown and selected "Master Branch" and clicked the "Save" button..
   *    The page was refreshed automatically.
   *    I scrolled down to the  GitHub Pages section  and found a link with a green background   "Your site is published at (https://faisalnadeem78.github.io/Milestone-Project-1/)"

#### Forking the GitHub Repository

Forking a GitHub Repository gives you an ability to make a copy of the original Repository on your GitHub account and it gets added to your own Repostaries section. You can make any changes to the Code without affecting the original Repository. Fork a GitHub Repository by using these steps.

  *    Log in to your GitHub account and find the [Github Repository](https://github.com/faisalnadeem78/Milestone-Project-1)
