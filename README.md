### **Project's Design Process**

   The Whole process of user experience design process is laid out on the following five UI/UX Planes.

###   Strategy Plane

   The obvious goal of any Business is to get an exposure by different advertisement means, referarls or word of mouth. A product or a project A Company makes could be anything like a  Website, a moible App, Online Flight Booking System or Weather checking App.

   The main questions asked in the strategy plane (in this Project which is a Gym's website) are
   *    Who is this site for?
   *    What are the aims of this Webiste?
   *    What can a user learn from this Website?
   *    Is the Website easy to navigate?

   The questions asked are the core elements of the Strategy Plane. The website answers all the questions in this strategy plance of UX Design process. 
   *    This Website is developed for the users who love staying fit or who wants to loss some weight, or tone their bodies, even who wants to get out of the daily dull routined life and take on a new healthy challenge.
   *    The main aims of this website is to get new customers, retain the current ones and retrieve the old ones.
   *    A User can learn about the facilisites offered in Gym. By showcasing upcoming workout classes and special offers.
   *    The website is easy to navigate, Its not cluttered with so many objects or crazy fonts or pixelated photos. A user can easisly find everything easily on the website and can reach the website owner in few clicks.

   I have designed this website on the above Strategy plane. The Website is easy to navigate. It is  aimed at the users who are into health and fitness. The Website visitors will find the helpful information about the Gym's offerings.

###   Scope Plane

   *    Does the Website has ample information for a user?

   *    It is a one page website with a Sticky Navbar on the top. It has Six sections anchored together with their respective sections. By clicking any Menu Item the user will be taken to that section.
   *    The Website is developed on the industry standard navgation system for a destkop, Tablet and a mobile user.
