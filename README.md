### **Project's Design Process**

   The Whole process of user experience design process is laid out on the following five UI/UX Planes.

####   Strategy Plane

   The obvious goal of any Business is to get an exposure by different advertisement means, referarls or word of mouth. A product or a project A Company makes could be anything like a  Website, a moible App, Online Flight Booking System or Weather checking App.

   The main questions asked in the strategy plane (in this Project which is a Gym's website) are
   *    Who is this site for?
   *    What are the aims of this Webiste?
   *    What can a user learn from this Website?
   *    Is the Website easy to navigate?

   The questions asked are the core elements of the Strategy Plane. The website answers all the questions in this strategy plance of UX Design process. 
   *    This Website is developed for the users who love staying fit or who wants to loss some weight, or tone their bodies, even who wants to get out of the daily dull routined life and take on a new healthy challenge.
   *    The main aims of this website is to get new customers, retain the current ones and retrieve the old ones.
   *    A User can learn about the facilisites offered in Gym. By showcasing upcoming workout classes and special offers.
   *    The website is easy to navigate, Its not cluttered with so many objects or crazy fonts or pixelated photos. A user can easisly find everything easily on the website and can reach the website owner in few clicks.

   I have designed this website on the above Strategy plane. The Website is easy to navigate. It is  aimed at the users who are into health and fitness. The Website visitors will find the helpful information about the Gym's offerings.

####   Scope Plane

   In this Plane of the UX Process I have designed this website on the basis of the strategy plane by adding the content and features for a Gym's Website. The following questions have been in answered in this Plance.
   *    What Content is provided on this Website?
   *    What functionalities are offered on this Website for a user to achieve his/her website visit?
   *    Does the Website has ample information for a user?
   *    Does the Webiste has specific features and elements to compete with others in the same business?

   All the above questions have been answered in the development of this Webiste. The website provides all the specific features and functions for a user to fully achieve his/her goal.

   *    The content provided on this website is for the people who are into fitness and healthy life style or who wants to join a Gym.
   *    A user can Join a particular workout class by click Join Button. A user can reach the Webiste owner by filling an onsite query form, by email or by phone a phone call. A user can choose any Gym's Subscription package by clicking that Package and sending the query to the Gym's Owner.
   *    The Website has all the information about the Team, Facilities, Classes, Fee structure, Contact information and Timings in the form photos, images and written content.
   *    The Website offers Upcoming and new Fitness trends and Offers free classes and Personal Training Sessions to stay ahead of their competitors.

 ####   Structure Plane
 
   Structue Plane is a very important stage of developing a Website. Its way of user's interaction with a website. The main aim of this plane is to make it is easy for a website's vistior to achieve its goal in 2 to 3 steps or in other words in few clicks. The Following Questions are answered in ths Plane.

   *    Can a user easily navigate the website?
   *    Does a user understand the structure of the website?
   *    Are the icons and images presented in an easy way for a user to understand the need of these elements?
   *    Can a user achieve his/her website visit in few clicks?
   *    Can a Developer or anyone managing the website easliy make any changes?

   The Structure of this website is laid out on the above questions. 
   *    It is a one page website with a Sticky Navbar on the top. It has Six sections anchored together with their respective sections. By clicking any Menu Item the user will be taken to that section.
   *    The Website is developed on the industry standard navgation system for a destkop, Tablet and a mobile user.
   *    The icons, Images, photos and all the other elemnts presented on the website clearly state their purpose and a user can simply understand their needs.
   *    A user can reach his/her goal withing 2-3 steps. The buttons provided on the website are linked to particular sections in a hierarchical structure.
   *    The Website structure or any addition in section can be achieved easily. All the coding is clearly marked withe comments for a particular section of the website. An industry standard framework is used to develope this website.

####    Skeleton Plane
   I have laid out the skeleton plane for a user to clearly understands the information and move around upon that information. Everthing is organised in a harmonious way for a user to navigate the website easily. I have Used XD Wireframes to achieve the presention of all the elements of skeleton Plane
   *    The Placement of Buttons, Images, Icons, Headings and text is placed accordingly.
   *    All the Elements and their functionality is easily accessible by a user of the website.
   *    The navigation system clearly indicates a user how to move around the website.
   *    The information given on the Website in the form of Text blocks, images or icons clearliy helps an easy user interaction.
   *    The wireframing is the most important element of the Skeleton plane. 
   Please see the Wireframes below.

####  Mobile Version

   ![Desktop-Tablet-Wireframe](https://github.com/faisalnadeem78/Milestone-Project-1/blob/master/documentation/UX/desktop-laptop-tablet.jpg)

####    Surface Plane
   Surface is the visual representation of the Website. It forms an interface with the colors, fonts, graphics and the icons used on the website. The Surface Plane is designed on the following questions.
   *    Is the interface user friendly?
   *    Do Colors and fonts incorporates with the theme of the Website?
   *    Do the images and text used on the website compliments each other?
   *    Do the images and icons used clearly represent their need and helps a user to interact with their functionality?

   The above questions were answered as a sum of all the planes in the development of the Surface plane.
   *    The Website as an interface is designed for an easy navigation for any device user. All the elements are presented according to the size and placement.
   *    I have used a dark interface for this Website thus used the combination dark and light colors for the background, fonts, buttons and image overlays.
